Getting started with Anaconda, or 'conda'

Anaconda is an open source data science and artificial intelligence distribution platform for Python and R programming languages. Conda gives you the standard packages used in scientific computing without having to worry about installing them all individually with their dependencies. 

 HOW TO USE THE SCRIPT: 

Save the script (or download it) as setup_conda_env.sh.
Make it executable, in your terminal type:
chmod +x setup_conda_env.sh
Run the script:
./setup_conda_env.sh

Ultimately, this script will: 
- Check for Conda
- Create an environment named myenv
- Install Python 3.9
- Install numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn
